#Design

The implementation is loosely based on Design 3 with the following amendments/enhancements:

-   on screens large enough to accommodate, a task view/edit screen should sit along side the task list
-   task status isn't binary, but instead tasks can be:
    -- not started
    -- in progress
    -- paused
    -- completed

-   on small screens, the task view/edit screen should be visible in a modal window
-   A statistics view is available as modal to give quick insights into the distibution sof tasks across statuses
